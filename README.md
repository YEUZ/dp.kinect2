* The current beta supports: depths, color images, IR, playermaps, skeletal tracking, point clouds, accelerometer, and some activities like opening/closing of hands.
* The final release will additionally support: face tracking, sound tracking, speech recognition, and moreâ€¦
* It is primarily developed and tested with Max 6.x for 32 and 64-bit platforms.
* It is based on the official Microsoft Kinect v2 platform. You will need at least v2.0 public preview of the Kinect v2 runtime/drivers to use this external.
* It is compatible with your dp.kinect patches. You may only have to add a "2" to the object name.

Known Issues
============

The quality of this beta is not representative of the final product; just as the Microsoft Kinect v2 drivers are not representative of their final quality. You may encounter bugs or less than full performance. I do not recommend using dp.kinect2 beta in any critical or live production scenario.
